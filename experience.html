      <div class="small-6 large-6 colums"><h5>
      During my first year of high school, I participated in an Excelsior Robotics club.  As a member, I helped with building the robot, and with the code of the robot.
      Being that we started our first project late and that there were only freshmen in the club at the time,
      it was difficult to finish building and coding the robot in the small amount of time that we had.  But we were diligent in our work ethic and ended up going
      all the way to the semi-finals.  This was a great experience for me as I was able to not only work with other students, I was able to gain experience in both hardware and software.

    <div class="small-6 large-6 colums"><h5>While in high school, I tried out and was accepted into our school football team.
        Football was great, as I not only got a chance to meet new people, it was great for me mentally as well.
        Football showed me what it means to be dedicated, have teamwork, and being able to perform when the stakes were high.
